This is a full-featured (at least developing to be so) game engine. Its main
purpose is to provide easy-to-use framework to game developers who like to have
access to the engine sources. DEM is licensed under the MIT license wich can be
found in License.txt in the same folder as this Readme file. All third-party
code licenses are in their respective folders.

Please note, that significant parts of this project evolved from
The Nebula Device engine (both versions 2 and 3) by RadonLabs. So, if you like
DEM, say "thanks a lot" to the Nebula's developers, as we do. We learned really
much about game software development from Nebula code.

Also we thank the authors of all that projects in 3rdParty directory of our
repo. They saved us lots of time, and the time is a true treasure. Thanks.

We constantly make efforts to make DEM better. If you want to and can help us,
you are welcome.
